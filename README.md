This is to provide trained classifiers for risk of PTSD in COVID-19 pandemic.
Users can use it to predict the risk of PTSD in COVID-19 pandemic once you have high-quality resting-state fucntional connectivity MRI data (rs-fcMRI)
Also, since this classifer was trained by just 42 participant, we also hope and welcome users to re-train this classifier achiving higher accucacy.
